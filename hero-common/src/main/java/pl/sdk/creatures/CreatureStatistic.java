If there is no room in your army for ordinary skeletons, necromancy skill will resurrect skeleton warriors, but there will be less of them than normal skeletons, so it might be a good idea not to upgrade cursed temple at all.",true),

    MEDUSA("Medusa", 9, 9, 25, 5, Range.closed(6,8), 4, "Very good creature, would be a better deal than beholder if had more than 4 shots... Keep an ammo cart handy and if your enemy has medusas, make sure it's the first machine you destroy. But when their shots run out, they still make great fighters with the stoning abbility, no match for basilisks though.\nSpecial: no hand-to-hand penalty, hand-to-hand attacks have 20% chance to turn enemies to stone: 3 rounds, take 50% damage, unstoned when attacked.", false),
    MINOTAUR("Minotaur", 14, 12, 50, 6, Range.closed(12,20), 5, "Good level 5 fighter with a reasonable price. Minotaur's strategy is pretty simple: just go and smash, although a little blessing would be very useful.

    HARPY_HAG("Harpy Hag", 6, 6, 14, 9, Range.closed(1,4), 2, "Great upgrade. Now you can annoy your enemies from 9 hexes away, like from the other side of castle walls without loosing any harpy hags. Take note that both harpies and harpy hags retreat back when attacking shooters, so sometimes it's better to move close without attacking to prevent the more powerful range attacks.\nSpecial: return to the hex they started from after an attack, no enemy retaliation.", true),
    EVIL_EYE("Evil Eye", 10, 8, 22, 7, Range.closed(3,5), 3, "Little all-around upgrade. Evil eyes make a good shooter unit and they don't die as quick as most low level shooters.\nSpecial: no hand-to-hand penalty.", true),
    MEDUSA_QUEEN("Medusa Queen", 10, 10, 30, 6, Range.closed(6,8), 4, "Definitely worth upgrading: double shots, extra health and other minor upgrades for only 30 gold.

    MINOTAUR_KING("Minotaur King", 15, 15, 50, 8, Range.closed(12,20), 5, "Good upgrade: 2 extra speed and much better defence rating. Smash strategy remains.\nSpecial: minotaur's morale is never below 1.", true),
    SCORPICORE("Scorpicore", 16, 14, 80, 11, Range.closed(14,20), 6, "Is there any actual difference between stoning and paralyzing? Hmmm... 200 gold for paralyzing, speed and 2 combat points... Scorpicores are a bit too expensive and 80 hit points is not enough - that's what happens when you breed a lion-bat-scorpion.\nSpecial: 20% chance to paralyze: take 50% damage, unparalyzed after 3 rounds or when attacked.", true),
    BLACK_DRAGON("Black Dragon", 25, 25, 300, 15, Range.closed(40,50), 7, "Little trick: titans do 150% damage to black dragons, but giants don't, so if you attack some giants, there's a definite bonus! Stronger than gold dragon, but not than archangel. Great for armageddon casters. Black dragons are terror of those heroes who have chosen magic over might, although there is one artifact that can break black dragon's spell immunity.\nSpecial: immune to all spells, 150% damage to giants and titans.", true);
